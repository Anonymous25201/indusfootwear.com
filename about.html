                <b><h2>Our History</h2></b>
                <p>
                    Founded in 1999 in Khairthal, Rajasthan, by Mr. Mahesh Kumar Chachlani, Indus Footwear began with a focus on slipper distribution, starting with a small team and basic resources. Over time, we expanded our operations and adopted advanced machinery to improve our manufacturing capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2011, we introduced a new line of men's footwear, marking a key phase in our growth. We expanded internationally, particularly into the Middle East, while maintaining a strong presence in India.
                </p>
